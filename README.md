A recursive, iterator-based implementation of merge sort algorithm in C++, plus a non-recursive, iterative version. The data structure being sorted does not need to be an array. It does need to
support random access iterators that allow randon access operators such as addition or subtraction of iterators, addition and subtraction with an integer,
deferencing and comparison.

See this [explanation](http://cplusplus.kurttest.com/notes/merge-sort.html#merge-sort>).
