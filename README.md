An iterator-base implementation of merge sort algorithm in C++. The data structure being sorted does not need to be an array. It only needs to
support the required operators such as addition with an integer (as well as substraction), deferencing and comparison.

See this [explanation](http://cplusplus.kurttest.com/notes/merge-sort.html#merge-sort>).
