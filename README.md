An iterator-base implementation of merge sort algorithm in C++. The data structure being sorted does not need to be an array. It only needs to
support iterators that allow randon access operators such as addition or subtraction of iterators, addition and subtraction with an integer, deferencing and comparison.

See this [explanation](http://cplusplus.kurttest.com/notes/merge-sort.html#merge-sort>).
