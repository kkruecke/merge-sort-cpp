Implement non-recursive version. Using the explanation at

http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~cheung/Courses/171/Syllabus/7-Sort/merge-sort5.html

It explains that the recursive, effectively sorts the adjacent one-lenth subarrays. Then merges the results, the adjacent two-element arrays, the adjacent length
four arrays, and so on, always increasing the subarray width by twice is prior value.
